# A* Search and Navigation

## Demo:

![demo](https://github.com/shangzhouye/search-and-navigation-public/blob/master/demo.png?raw=true)

## Overview:

This project implemented an A* search algorithm to generate 2-D path that navigates while avoilding obstacles, as well as a controller that enables a differential wheeled robot to drive the path.

## Environment

- Landmarks from `MRCLAM_Dataset9, Robot3` (Autonomous Space Robotics Lab, University of Toronto) [(Link)](http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/datasets/mrclam/index.html) was used as obstacles.

- Robot is only able to observe the obstacles in its eight neighbour cells.

- Allowed cell transitions are its eight neighbour cells.

## Modules

### astar.py

- A grid with cell sizes 0.1m or 1m was built.

- The heuristic function used is the scaled straight-line distance between the current position and the goal position. 

- True cost +1 to move into a neighbor cell , +1000 to move into an occupied cell.

- Account for the physical size of a robot by inflating the size of detected obstacles.

- An offline A* search algorithm was implemented (assume that have knowledge of which cells are occupied). 

### online_astar.py

- An online A* search that plans as the robot moves and does not have a *priori* knowledge of the obstacles was implemented.

- The robot has the capability to build a map while exploring the world.

### robotcontroller.py

- Designed an inverse kinematic porpotional steering and speed controller which drives the path generated by online A* search.

- The robot is able to track the waypoint with go-to-goal control algorithm.

- Restricted the maximum acceleraton and added noise to be more realistic.

### run.py

- The robot, at each step, do online planning, execute the next chosen step using inverse kinematic controller and repeat the procedure until reach the goal.

## How to run the code

- The code is written in python 2.7

- Run the code `run.py`

   - Figure 1~3 shows the online plan with 0.1m grid size and inflated obstacles.

   - Figure 4~6 shows the navigation trajectory of the robot.

   - Figure 7~9 shows the navigation trajectory of the robot with the fine grid1 with 0.1m grid size.
